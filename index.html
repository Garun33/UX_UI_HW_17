                <p>Hi!! Thanks for stopping by! </p>
                <p> I am a former biotechnologist, turned UX designer. After years of working as a biotechnologist I found myself wanting a desire to engage myself creatively. I have always been drawn to arts, I enjoyed being surrounded by soothing music and my paintings including those failed ones, since as a child. </p>
                <p>UX design appealed to me as it embodies many elements of my science profession, including user-centric products, research analysis, and attention to detail. I am passionate about improving lives through design and constantly looking to learn and grow.</p>
                 <p>I consider design as an art, and if something has to last, it has to be an art. A work that combines visual design with usability is well worth the undertaking. I enjoy empathising with people and crafting meaningful experiences.</p>
                <p>When I am not working, you will find me being with my family and spending time with our favorite furry companion Coco, a spoiled lab! I love being close to the lush nature and wavy waterfronts, ohh not to mention my love for food. </p>
